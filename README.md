RPi(SPI), Arduino(GPRS), VideoRecorder(Java-basic)
1. RaspberryPi (Python, C): forces current into an external breadboard circuit and reads voltage across another pin on the RPi. SPI interface used. threading, matplotlib used. For speed, C code run from inside the python code. (Old code)
2. Arduino: Acts as a vehicle fare meter, had GPS(to push coordinates to server), GPRS module(for data and voice call), every day morning parameters are downloaded from a central server and these parameters are used by the vehicle to calculate fare at the end of a trip. data stored in SD card, basic LCD for display (Old code)
3. Java VideoRecorder (Java): Video record, image capture of live stream from webcam or external usb camera. (Old code, multiple bugs). Just a practice code for learning Java.
